## Feature Highlights

### Pet Management API
The core Pet Management API allows developers to create, read, update, and delete pet records in the system. Each pet entity includes detailed information such as name, species, breed, age, and availability status. 

Our pets endpoint supports filtering by status, allowing users to quickly find available pets for adoption. Additionally, pet records can be tagged with multiple categories for enhanced searchability.

```http
GET /pets?status=available
```

### Store Operations
The Store Operations API enables inventory management and order processing. Store managers can track product inventory, process orders, and manage shipping details all through a unified interface.

Each order contains a reference to the purchased pet, customer information, and delivery status. The API supports real-time order updates and webhook notifications for status changes.

```json
POST /store/orders
{
  "petId": 123,
  "quantity": 1,
  "shipDate": "2024-03-05T12:00:00Z",
  "status": "placed"
}
```

### User Authentication
Secure user authentication provides personalized experiences for both pet store staff and customers. The API implements OAuth2 for secure access token management and role-based access control.

Users can register, login, and manage their profiles with support for password recovery and email verification.
