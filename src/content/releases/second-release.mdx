## Service Advisories

### Authentication Token Format Change
The format of authentication tokens has been updated to include additional security features. Existing tokens will continue to work until April 15, 2024, but all applications should update to use the new token format. See the [migration guide](/docs/auth/token-migration) for details.

### Pet Status Enumeration Change
The pet status field now accepts a specific set of enumerated values: "available", "pending", "adopted", and "unavailable". The previous value "sold" has been deprecated and is now mapped to "adopted". Please update your applications accordingly.

## Feature Highlights

<Card>
### Advanced Pet Search
We've completely revamped the pet search functionality to make it more powerful and user-friendly. The new search API supports:

- Full-text search across pet names and descriptions
- Advanced filtering by multiple attributes (age, size, breed, etc.)
- Geolocation-based search to find pets near a specific location
- Sorting and pagination options for better results handling

Example usage:
```http
GET /pets/search?query=friendly&species=dog&maxAge=5&location=90210&radius=25mi
```

This feature helps potential pet adopters quickly find their perfect match based on their specific preferences and location.

### Integrated Payment Processing
The store API now includes integrated payment processing capabilities. Developers can create and manage payments directly through our API, simplifying the checkout process for pet adoptions and product purchases.

The payment API supports:
- Multiple payment methods (credit cards, PayPal, etc.)
- Automatic receipt generation
- Refund and partial payment handling
- Secure tokenization of payment information

Example usage:
```json
POST /store/orders/{orderId}/payments
{
  "amount": 129.99,
  "currency": "USD",
  "method": "credit_card",
  "paymentDetails": {
    "tokenizedCard": "tok_visa_4242",
    "saveForFuture": true
  }
}
```
</Card>

### Pet Health Records API
Pet health information can now be stored and retrieved through our API. This allows for seamless tracking of vaccinations, medical history, and special care instructions for each pet in the system.

Veterinarians and pet care providers can access and update these records with proper authorization, ensuring that all pet health information is current and accurate.
