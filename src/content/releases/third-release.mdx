## Service Advisories

### Base URL Change for Testing Environment
The base URL for the testing environment has changed from `https://test-api.petstore.com` to `https://api-test.petstore.com`. All test integrations should be updated by May 1, 2024. The production environment URL remains unchanged.

### Deprecation of Legacy Order Endpoints
The legacy order endpoints (`/store/orders/legacy/*`) will be removed in the next release. Please migrate to the new order endpoints (`/store/orders/*`) as soon as possible. See the [migration guide](/docs/store/order-migration) for detailed instructions.

## Feature Highlights

<Card>
### Enhanced Pet Profiles
We've enhanced our pet profiles with a rich set of features to better showcase each pet's personality and characteristics. The new profiles include:

- Support for multiple high-resolution photos and videos
- Personality trait scoring to help match pets with potential owners
- Behavioral assessment reporting
- Care requirements and recommendations
- Timeline of significant events in the pet's life

These enhancements help potential adopters get a better understanding of each pet before making an adoption decision, leading to better matches and happier homes.

Example usage:
```http
GET /pets/{petId}/profile
```

### Appointment Scheduling API
Our new scheduling API allows customers to book appointments for pet viewings, veterinary services, grooming, and training sessions. The API handles:

- Available time slot discovery
- Booking creation and management
- Automatic reminders and notifications
- Staff assignment and resource allocation
- Rescheduling and cancellation policies

This system integrates with popular calendar platforms, making it easy for both staff and customers to manage their appointments.

Example usage:
```json
POST /appointments
{
  "type": "pet_viewing",
  "petId": 456,
  "customerId": 789,
  "proposedTimes": [
    "2024-04-15T14:00:00Z",
    "2024-04-16T10:30:00Z",
    "2024-04-16T15:45:00Z"
  ],
  "notes": "Interested in adopting this golden retriever, would like to bring my children to meet the dog"
}
```

### Webhooks for Real-time Updates
Developers can now subscribe to real-time updates through our webhook system. Get notified immediately when events occur in the system, such as:

- New pets added to inventory
- Pet status changes (e.g., when a pet becomes available)
- Order status updates
- Appointment confirmations or changes
- Health record updates

This enables developers to build reactive applications that respond immediately to changes within the PetStore ecosystem.

Example subscription:
```javascript
POST /webhooks
{
  "events": ["pet.status.changed", "order.status.changed"],
  "targetUrl": "https://example.com/webhook-handler",
  "secret": "your_webhook_signing_secret"
}
```
