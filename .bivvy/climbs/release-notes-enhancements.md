# Release Notes Component Enhancement

## Overview
This climb is focused on enhancing the release notes page to automatically populate content from a dedicated release notes content collection. The page will display release notes in chronological order with proper styling and formatting.

## Goals
- Create a properly typed content collection for release notes
- Fix existing type errors in the release notes component
- Ensure proper rendering of release notes with correct date formatting
- Maintain consistent styling with the Starlight theme

## Implementation Details

### Content Collection Configuration
- Add a `releases` schema to the content configuration
- Define required frontmatter fields:
  - `title`: string - The title of the release
  - `date`: string - Release date in ISO format
  - `excerpt`: string - Short summary of the release

### Component Fixes
- Fix type errors in `release-notes.astro` by properly typing the imported content
- Update `ReleaseNoteCard.astro` to handle the content structure correctly
- Ensure proper date formatting for display

### Styling Enhancements
- Maintain the existing card-based layout for release notes
- Use Starlight's built-in variables for consistent theming
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes

## Success Criteria
- No TypeScript/linter errors in the codebase
- Release notes display in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Each release note shows the title, formatted date, and content
- Design matches the Starlight theme

## Testing Plan
- Verify correct rendering with existing content files
- Test with multiple release notes to ensure sorting works
- Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Dependencies
- Starlight components
- Astro content collections
